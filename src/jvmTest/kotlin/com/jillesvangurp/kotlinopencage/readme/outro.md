The README is generated from source files in [`src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/jillesvangurp/kotlinopencage/readme/ReadmeGenerationTest.kt`](src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/jillesvangurp/kotlinopencage/readme/ReadmeGenerationTest.kt) by 
[kotlin4example](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kotlin4example). This is a library that I created
to make generating markdown with working code examples really easy. If you want to create pull requests against the documentation, just modify the source and rerun the tests to regenerate the readme.
