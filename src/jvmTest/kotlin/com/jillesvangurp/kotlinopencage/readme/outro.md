## Multi platform

This is a Kotlin multi platform library that should work on most  kotlin platforms (jvm, js, ios, android, etc). Wasm will be added later, after Kotlin 2.0 stabilizes.

## Development

To run the tests, you need to configure a valid Opencage API key. You can get one from opencage and they also provide special keys for testing. 

To configure this either set the `OPENCAGE_KEY` environment variable, supply a `local.properties` file with the `opencageApiKey` property, or set the `opencageApiKey` system property. Any of those should work.

Run `./gradlew build` to build. The project should load fine in recent versions of Intellij (community edition).

The README is generated from source files in [`src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/jillesvangurp/kotlinopencage/readme/ReadmeGenerationTest.kt`](src/jvmTest/kotlin/com/jillesvangurp/kotlinopencage/readme/ReadmeGenerationTest.kt) by 
[kotlin4example](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kotlin4example). This is a library that I created
to make generating markdown with working code examples really easy. If you want to create pull requests against the documentation, just modify the source and rerun the tests to regenerate the readme.
